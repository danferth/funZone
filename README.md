funZone
=======

funZone *(work in progress)* is a PHP based website using text files and arrays *(no db)* for the pages and nav items.  This way clients can fill in the blanks on text templates and upload to the server without knowing any code.

The result will auto update the navigation and pages.  Included an option to have a page spacific `.css` file to custom style the individual pages.

Items to be completed soon
--------------------------
- clean up old css and site structure as this project was started two years ago *(2010)* and I've learned alot since then - *don't you love looking at old code and thinking 'what was i thinking this is horrible'*
- find way to make prettier URLs
- rewrite css to have base starting point
- add basic forms with js check and loop to eliminate spam from bots
